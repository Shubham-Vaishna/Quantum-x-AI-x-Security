# 🧠 Quantum × AI × Security — Research Journal

Welcome — this repository is my personal research journal exploring the intersection of **Quantum Computing**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Cybersecurity**.  
Here I write short, human-level summaries of research papers I read, with practical reflections and small reproducible notes or demos when possible.

## 🧩 Purpose & How I use this journal
- Write **concise, 1–2 page** summaries in plain English to internalize complex research.  
- Keep a record of ideas, open questions, and reproducible mini-experiments that could become a thesis proposal or portfolio piece.  
- Share with potential supervisors as evidence of research interest and progress.
